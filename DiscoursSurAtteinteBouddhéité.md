#sur Le sens d'être Bouddha dans l'instant#

##Preuves scripturaires##
Question: Divers sutras et traités insistent sur fait qu'il faut trois grands éons pour devenir un Bouddha. Quelles sont les preuves qui permettent de postuler le principe de l'atteinte de la bouddhéité dés ce corps?  
Réponse: L'Ansi-venu l'a expliqué dans la Chambre aux trésors secrête.  

Question: Comment est-ce expliqué dans ces sutra?  
Réponse: Dans le Kongôchô Kyô(T. 19:320c) il est expliqué:  
>"Celui qui pratique ce samadhi réalisera l'Eveil du Bouddha.
>Ce samadhi est celui de l'Honoré Ichiji Kinrin Ô."

Il dit aussi(T. 18: 331b):
>"Si un Être rencontre cet Enseignement et le pratique  
>au quatre moments du jour  et de la nuit il réalise    
>le "stage de la Joie" dans cette vie et accomplira l'  
>Eveil sans supérieur dans ses prochaines 16 vies."  

Remarque au sujet de cette citation:  
"Cet Enseignement" est une référence au Roi des Enseignements sur le samadhi réalisé par le Hôbutsu lui-même.  
Le "stage de la Joie" n'est pas la première Terre de l'exotérisme, mais le premier stage de notre Véhicule Bouddhique comme expliqué dans notre châpitre sur les stages.  
"Seize vie" est une référence à la génération des seize Grands Bodhisattva comme expliqué dans notre châpitre sur les stages. 

Il est aussi dit(T.19: 594a):
>"Si l'on est capable de pratiquer selon ce principe    
>suprême, on est assuré du succés quant à l'atteinte  
>de l'Eveil sans supérieur dans cette vie."

Il est aussi dit(T.18: 329a):
>"Sachez que votre propre corps devient le royaume    
>adamantin.[...]   
>Quand votre propre corps devient un vajra, il est     
>ferme, solide et indestructible.    
>Je suis devenu un corps adamantin."  

Dans le Dainichi Kyô il est dit:(T. 18: 21a):
>"Sans abandonner ce corps on obtient les pouvoirs   
>surnaturels sur le monde objectif, on s'ébat dans la    
>station de l'Espace et on accomplit le Mystère du  
>corps."

Il est aussi dit(T. 18: 45c):
>"Si vous souhaitez l'accomplissement dans cette vie,  
>suivez une pratique appropriée et méditez dessus.  
>Si vous recevez un rite mantrique de la part d'un vénérable,  
>Pratiquez le et fusionnez avec la Divinité, vous  
>réussirez."    

Remarque au sujet de cette citation: Dans ce passage il fait référence aux Siddhi mondaines et supramondaines du Hôbutsu que l'on obtient en récitant des mantras.    
La "station de l'Espace" veut dire que Hôshin est comme l'élément Espace, inobstrusif, contient tous les phénomènes et éternel. Comme toute chose en est dépendante on parle de station.


“Mystery of the body”: the three mysteries of the Dharma-Buddha
are di‡cult to see even for [bodhisattvas of ] equal enlightenment,
and so how can they be glimpsed by [bodhisattvas of ] the ten
stages?—therefore it is called “mystery of the body.”
381c
Becoming a Buddha
67
Again, in the bodhisattva Någårjuna’s Treatise on the Bodhimind
it is stated (T. 32: 572c):
[Only] in the mantra teachings does one become a Buddha in
this very body, and therefore they explain the methods of
samådhi; in other teachings these are missing and have not
been recorded.
<[Remarks:] “They explain the methods of samådhi” refers to
the samådhi realized by the Dharma body itself. “Other teachings”
are the exoteric teachings expounded by the other-enjoyment body.>
It also says (T. 32: 574c):
If someone seeking the Buddha’s wisdom should penetrate
the bodhi-mind,
He will quickly realize the stage of great enlightenment
with the body born of his parents.
It is in accordance with these corroborative passages based on
doctrine and reason that this principle [of becoming a Buddha in
this very body] is established.
II. The Verse on Becoming a Buddha
in This Very Body
[Question:] What are the di›erent meanings of the words [“becoming
a Buddha in this very body” as expounded] in these sutras and
treatise?
[Answer:] Here are [two] stanzas:
The six elements are unobstructed and eternally in a state
of yoga; <—Essence>
The four kinds of ma√∂a[la]s are not separate from one
another; <—Aspect>
When empowered by the three mysteries, [Buddhahood] is
quickly manifested. <—Function>
K¥kai Texts
68
The manifold interconnectedness of Indra’s net is called
“this very body.” <—Nonobstruction>
Naturally endowed with sarvajñåna;
Mental functions and mind-kings are more numerous than
the dust motes of [countless] lands,
Each possessed of the five wisdoms, of infinite wisdom;
And because of the power [to function] as a perfect mirror
there is the real wisdom of enlightenment. <—Becoming
a Buddha>4
Interpretative Remarks: These two stanzas in eight lines extol
the four words “becoming a Buddha in this very body” (soku-shinjø-
butsu). That is to say, these four words contain infinite meaning,
and none of the Buddha’s teachings goes beyond this single
phrase. Therefore, these two stanzas were composed in brief so as
to reveal its infinite virtues.
The content of the stanzas is divided into two: the first stanza
extols the two words “in this very body” (soku-shin), and the next
stanza extols the two words “becoming a Buddha” ( jø-butsu). In
the first [stanza] there are again four [sections]: the first line
[expresses] essence, the second aspect, the third function, and the
fourth nonobstruction. In the following stanza there are [also] four
[sections]: the first [line] gives the Buddhahood of the Dharma-
Buddha, the next expresses innumerableness, the third reveals
perfection, and the last presents the reason.
1. The Six Elements Are Unobstructed
and Eternally in a State of Yoga
Remarks: The “six elements” are the five elements plus consciousness.
In the Mahåvairocana Sutra it says (T. 18: 9b):
I (Vairocana) awoke to original non-birth, transcended the
path of speech,
Obtained liberation from all faults, dissociated myself from
causes and conditions,
382a
Becoming a Buddha
69
And knew emptiness, which is like empty space.
This represents the meaning [of the six elements]. His (Vairocana’s)
seed-mantra is: A vi ra h¥μ khaμ h¥μ.5 That the letter
A signifies the original non-birth (ådyanutpåda) of all dharmas
corresponds to the earth element; that the letter Va stands for dissociation
from speech (våc) signifies the water element; that which
is pure and without defilement (rajas) corresponds to the letter Ra
and the fire element; the inapprehensibility of causes (hetu) and
karma (i.e., conditions) represents the gateway of the letter Ha
and the wind element; and “like empty space (kha)” is the super -
ficial meaning of the letter Khaμ, and it corresponds to the space
element. “I awoke” represents the consciousness element—in the
causal stage [of practice] it is called “consciousness,” and in the
resultant stage [of awakening] it is called “wisdom,” for wisdom is
equivalent to awakening. The Sanskrit words buddha and bodhi
are derived from the same word (i.e., budh: “to awaken”), and
buddha denotes “awaken[ed one],” while bodhi means “wisdom.”
Therefore, [the term] samyaksaμbodhi (perfect awakening) mentioned
in various sutras was formerly rendered [in Chinese] as
“universal knowledge” and later translated as “equal awakening,”
since the meanings of “awakening” and “knowledge” are interconnected.
The reason that this sutra refers to consciousness as
awakening [in the phrase “I awoke”] is that it takes the dominant
[sense in the resultant stage]. It is only a distinction between cause
and result and a di›erence between the fundamental and the derivative.
The verse from this sutra makes this statement with reference
to the samådhis of the Five Buddhas.6
Again, in the Adamantine Pinnacle Sutra it says (T. 18: 331a):
All dharmas are originally unborn; their [inherent] nature
is dissociated from verbal discourse;
They are pure and untainted; they consist of causes and
karma, and are like empty space.
This is again the same as [the above quotation from] the Mahåvairocana
Sutra. “All dharmas” means all mental dharmas. The
K¥kai Texts
70
mind-kings and mental functions are immeasurable in number;
therefore it says “all.” “Mind” and “consciousness” are di›erent
words with similar meaning. Therefore, Vasubandhu and others
established the principle of consciousness-only7 with [the thesis
that] the three realms are mind-only. The rest [of the above quotation]
is the same as explained above [in connection with the quotation
from the Mahåvairocana Sutra].
Again, in the Mahåvairocana Sutra it says (T. 18: 38bc):
I am identical with the station of the mind, sovereign
everywhere,
And universally pervade various sentient and non-sentient
beings.
The letter A stands for primary life, the letter Va refers to
water,
The letter Ra refers to fire, the letter H¥μ refers to wind,8
And the letter Kha is the same as empty space.
In the first [half-]line of this scriptural passage—“I am identical
with the station of the mind”—“mind” refers to consciousnesswisdom.
The last five [half-]lines refer to the five elements. The
middle three [half-]lines express the function of sovereignty and
attribute of nonobstruction of the six elements. The Prajñå[påra -
mitå] Sutra (e.g., T. 5: 704b, 979c, 990b), the Necklace Sutra (cf. T.
16: 19c; T. 24: 1013a), and so on also explain the principle of the six
elements.
These six elements create all Buddhas, all sentient beings, and
the physical world, [that is,] the fourfold Dharma body and threefold
world. Therefore, the Honored One Vairocana expounded the
following verses on generation of the Tathågata (T. 18: 31a):
[The six elements] produce in forms according to their kind
dharmas and dharma marks,
Buddhas, Ωravakas, world-saving pratyekabuddhas,
Hosts of valiant bodhisattvas, and likewise the honored
among men;
Becoming a Buddha
71
Sentient beings and the physical world are established in
succession,
And dharmas that are born, abide, and so on are
perpetually produced in this manner.9
[Question:] What meaning do these verses express?
[Answer:] They show that the six elements produce the fourfold
Dharma body, the [four kinds of ] ma√∂alas, and the threefold
world. “Dharmas” is mental dharmas and “dharma marks” is material
dharmas. Then again, “dharmas” gives the general term and
“dharma marks” indicates their distinctions. Therefore, in the following
lines it says that Buddhas, Ωravakas, pratyekabuddhas,
bodhisattvas, sentient beings, and the physical world are established
in succession. Then again, “dharmas” is the dharma-ma√∂ala,
“dharma marks” is the samaya bodies (i.e., symbolic figures) [represented
in the samaya-ma√∂ala], and “Buddhas…sentient beings”
is the bodies (i.e., figures) [represented] in the great ma√∂ala (mahama√∂
ala). The “physical world” represents the ground by which
they are supported, and this “physical world” is a generic term for
the samaya-ma√∂ala.10 Then again, “Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and
the two vehicles” represents the world of the wise and enlightened,
“sentient beings” is the world of sentient beings, and “physical
world” is, namely, the physical world. Then again, [the subject of ]
“produce” is the six elements and “in forms according to their kind”
is the dharmas that are produced, and these are, namely, the fourfold
Dharma body and the threefold world.
Therefore, next it also says (T. 18: 31a):
Lord of Mysteries, there are instances in which the positions,
seed[-syllables], and insignia of the sacred deities of the
ma√∂ala are set up [on the person of the practitioner]. You
should listen attentively […] as I now explain it.
He (Vairocana) then spoke the following verses (T. 18: 31a):
The mantra practitioner first situates a circular altar
(ma√∂ala) in his own body:
382b
K¥kai Texts
72
From the feet to the navel constitutes a great adamantine
circle;
From here to the heart he should imagine a water circle;
Above the water circle is a fire circle, and above the fire
circle is a wind circle.
Remarks: The “adamantine circle” is the letter A, and the letter
A corresponds to the earth [element]. The water, fire, and wind
[elements] are to be known in accordance with the [quoted] passage.
The “circular altar” is the space [element], and “mantra practitioner”
is the mind element. The “sacred deities” mentioned in
the prose section are the great body [corresponding to the figures
represented in the great ma√∂ala], the “seed[-syllables]” are the
dharma body [corresponding to the letters represented in the
dharma-ma√∂ala], and the “insignia” are the samaya body [corresponding
to the insignia represented in the samaya-ma√∂ala];
the karma body is possessed by each of the [above] three bodies. As
for a more detailed explanation, it is explained extensively in the
text of the sutra and should be known by referring to the text.
[In the Mahåvairocana Sutra] it also says (T. 18: 19c):
The Honored One Vairocana […] said: “Vajrapa√i, there are
born of the minds of Tathågatas the play of activity and dance
of practice which display a wide variety of forms, encompass
the four realms, abide in the mind-king, are like empty space,
accomplish vast fruits visible and invisible, and give birth to
the stages of all Ωravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas.”
[Question:] What meaning does this passage express?
[Answer:] It shows that the six elements produce everything.
[Question:] How can this be known?
[Answer:] “Mind-king” is the consciousness element, “encompass
the four realms” is the four elements, and “equivalent to empty
space” is the space element. These six elements are the producer.
“Visible and invisible” is the realms of desire 382c and form and the
Becoming a Buddha
73
realm of non-form. The rest is as [stated] in the text, and it corresponds
to the dharmas that are produced.
Scriptural passages such as these all regard the six elements
as the producer and regard the four Dharma bodies and three
worlds as the produced. These dharmas that are produced range
from the Dharma body above to the six paths below, and although
there are divisions between gross and fine and di›erences between
large and small, they still do not go beyond the six elements. Therefore,
the Buddha taught that the six elements constitute the essential
nature of the Dharma realm.
In the exoteric teachings the four elements are regarded as nonsentient,
but the esoteric teaching explains that they are the samaya
bodies of the Tathågata. The four elements are not separate from
the mind element. Although mind and matter are di›er ent, their
nature is the same. Matter is mind, and mind is matter, and they
are [mutually] unhindered and unobstructed. The knower (lit., “wisdom”)
is the known (lit., “object”), and the known is the knower; the
knower is the [truth-]principle [that is known], and the [truth-]principle
is the knower—they are [mutually] unobstructed and absolutely
free. Although there are both producer and produced, they completely
transcend [distinctions between] active and passive. In the
truth-principle as it naturally is, what kind of creative action can
there be? Terms such as active and passive are all secret designations,
and, clinging to their conventional and superficial meanings,
one should not engage in various frivolous arguments.
Bodies composed of these six elements, the essential nature of
the Dharma realm, are unhindered and unobstructed, they interpenetrate
and intercorrespond, they are everlasting and immutable,
and they abide in the same way in ultimate reality. Therefore it
says in the stanza, “The six elements are unobstructed and eternally
in a state of yoga.” “Unobstructed” means “[inter]penetrating freely”;
“eternally” means “immovable,” “indestructible,” and so on; “yoga”
is translated as “intercorrespondence,” and intercorrespondent
[inter]penetration is, namely, the meaning of “very” (soku) [in the
phrase “becoming a Buddha in this very body”].

2. The Four Kinds of Ma√∂a[la]s Are Not
Separate from One Another
As for “The four kinds of ma√∂a[la]s are not separate from one
another,” the Mahåvairocana Sutra (T. 18: 44a) states that all
Tathågatas have three kinds of secret bodies, namely, letter, seal,
and image. “Letter” is the dharma-ma√∂ala; “seal” means various
insignia, that is, the samaya-ma√∂ala; and “image” is the physical
body endowed with the [thirty-two] major characteristics and
[eighty] minor marks [of a Buddha], that is, the great ma√∂ala.
These three kinds of bodies are each possessed of deportment and
activity, and this is called the karma-ma√∂ala. These are called
the four kinds of ma√∂alas.
According to the explanation in the Adamantine Pinnacle Sutra
(e.g., T. 18: 898c–899a; T.19: 609b), the four kinds of ma√∂alas are:
1. Great ma√∂ala (mahå-ma√∂ala): it refers to each Buddha’s
and bodhisattva’s [physical] body [endowed with] the major
characteristics and minor marks. Painting their images is
also called a great ma√∂ala. Again, accomplishing deity yoga
by means of the five phases11 is also called “great wisdomseal”
[and this too corresponds to the great ma√∂ala].
2. Samaya-ma√∂ala: it is, namely, the insignia held [by the
deities], such as the sword, wheel-treasure,12 vajra, lotus, and
the like. If one draws their images, this is also [a samayama√∂
ala]. Again, joining one’s two hands together [with the
fingers interlocked] in the adamantine bind and generating
the formation of seals (mudrås)13 is also called “samaya wisdom-
seal” [and this too corresponds to the samaya-ma√∂ala].
3. Dharma-ma√∂ala: it is the seed[-syllable] and mantra of
one’s deity. If one writes the seed-syllables [of various deities],
each in its proper position, this is [also a dharma-ma√∂ala].
Again, the samådhis of the Dharma body and the words and
meanings of all scriptures are all also called “dharma wisdomseals”
[and these too correspond to the dharma-ma√∂ala].
383a
Becoming a Buddha
75
4. Karma-ma√∂ala: it is, namely, the various deportments and
activities of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and so on. [Images] either
cast in metal or molded in clay too are also called “karma wisdom-
seals” [and these too correspond to the karma-ma√∂ala].
These four kinds of ma√∂alas or four kinds of wisdom-seals
( jñåna-mudrå) are immeasurable in their number, and the measure
of each is equal to empty space. That is not separate from this,
and this is not separate from that, just as space and light are unobstructed
[by each other] and do not resist [each other]. Therefore
it says, “The four kinds of ma√∂a[la]s are not separate from one
another.” “Not separate” is, namely, the meaning of “very” (soku)
[in the phrase “becoming a Buddha in this very body”].
3. When Empowered by the Three Mysteries,
[Buddhahood] Is Quickly Manifested
As for “When empowered by the three mysteries, [Buddhahood]
is quickly manifested,” the “three mysteries” are 1) the mystery
of the body, 2) the mystery of speech, and 3) the mystery of the
mind. The three mysteries of the Dharma-Buddha are so profound
and subtle that even [bodhisattvas of ] equal enlightenment and
the ten stages are unable to see or hear them, and therefore they
are called “mysteries.”
Each deity is possessed of three mysteries [as innumerable as]
the dust motes of [countless] lands, and they mutually empower
each other and encompass one another. The three mysteries of sentient
beings are also like this. Therefore, it is called empowerment
by the three mysteries. If a mantra practitioner should examine
the meaning of this, make seal-pledges (i.e., mudrås) with his
hands, recite mantras with his mouth, and dwell in samådhi with
his mind, he will quickly obtain great siddhi on account of the
intercorrespondence and empowerment of the three mysteries [of
his deity and himself ]. Therefore, it says in a sutra (T. 19: 322c):
Each syllable of this three-syllable mantra of the Buddha
K¥kai Texts
76
Vai ro cana (oμ bh¥˙ khaμ) is immeasurable [in its
e‡cacy].
If [a practitioner] should seal his heart with [Vairocana’s]
seal and [this] mantra, he will accomplish mirrorlike
wisdom
And quickly obtain the adamantine firm essence of the
bodhi-mind;
If he seals his forehead, one should know that he will
accomplish the wisdom of equality
And quickly obtain a body adorned with the aggregate of
merit of the stage of consecration;
When he seals his mouth with the mantra, he will
accomplish the wisdom of wondrous observation,
Whereupon he will turn the Dharma wheel and obtain the
Buddha’s wisdom body;
If he recites the mantra and seals the crown [of his head],
he will accomplish the wisdom of accomplishing what is
to be done,
Realize the Buddha’s transformation bodies, and subdue
those di‡cult to control;
And if he empowers his [whole] person with this seal and
mantra,
He will accomplish the wisdom of the essential nature of
the Dharma realm and the Buddha Vairocana’s body of
the Dharma realm, [which is like] empty space.
It also says (T. 19: 602a):
[The practitioner] enters the meditation on the thusness
(tathatå) of the Dharma body, in which the agent of cognition
and object of cognition are one, undi›erentiated like
empty space. If he is able to concentrate [on this meditation]
and practice uninterruptedly, then he will in his present lifetime
enter the first stage and quickly collect the stock of merit
and wisdom [normally collected] in one great asaμkhyeya
eon; on account of being empowered by many Tathågatas, he
Becoming a Buddha
77
will reach the tenth stage and [the stages of ] equal enlightenment
and wondrous enlightenment and be endowed with
[the wisdom of a] sarvajña (omniscient one); self and other
will be undi›erentiated, he will be identical with the Dharma
body of all Tathågatas, and he will always benefit infinite
sentient beings with unconditional great compassion and perform
great Buddha deeds.
It also says (T. 20: 535bc):
If [a practitioner] has recourse to the Dharma of the innerly
realized and self-awakened sacred wisdom expounded by the
self-enjoyment body of the Buddha Vairocana and to the wisdom
of the other-enjoyment body of Great Samantabhadra-
Vajrasattva, then he will in his present lifetime encounter
a ma√∂ala åcårya (teacher) and be able to enter a ma√∂ala.
Having completed the karman (ordination rite), [the åcårya]
will induct Vajrasattva into his body by means of the
samådhi of Samantabhadra. On account of the majestic
power of empowerment he will instantly realize innumerable
samayas and innumerable dhara√Δ gateways. By inconceivable
methods [the åcårya] will transmute the disciple’s
seeds of innate self-attachment, at which time he will accumulate
in his person the merit and wisdom [normally] collected
in one great asaμkhyeya eon, whereupon he will be
deemed to have been born into the Buddha’s family. That
person, born from the minds of all Tathågatas, born from
the mouth of the Buddha, born from the Dharma of the
Buddha, and born of conversion by the Dharma, will obtain
the Buddha’s Dharma wealth. “Dharma wealth” means the
teachings of the bodhi-mind [based on] the three mysteries.
<This indicates the benefits obtained through the åcårya’s
expedient means of empowerment when one is first conferred
the precepts of the bodhi-mind.>
By just seeing the ma√∂ala he instantly has pure faith,
and because he gazes at it reverently with a joyful mind, he
383b
K¥kai Texts
78
plants the seeds of the Adamantine Realm in his ålaya-consciousness
(ålaya-vijñåna: “storehouse-consciousness”). <This
passage indicates the benefits obtained upon first seeing the
deities of the [vast] oceanlike assembly of the ma√∂ala.>
He receives in full an adamantine name of initiation to
the position [of an initiate], and hereafter he will obtain vast,
profound, and inconceivable teachings and transcend the two
vehicles and ten stages. If he mentally applies himself and
practices this Dharma gateway of the yoga of the Five Mysteries
of Great Vajrasattva uninterruptedly during the four
watches and throughout the four activities of walking, standing,
sitting, and lying down, then in the objective realm of
what is seen, heard, sensed, and perceived his attachment to
the emptiness of both persons and things [will disappear and]
everything will all be equal, and he will realize the first stage
in his present life and gradually advance [to higher stages].
By cultivating the Five Mysteries he will be neither tainted
by nor attached to nirvana or birth-and-death. In the boundless
[cycle of ] birth-and-death in the five destinies he will
widely act to benefit [others], and he will divide his person
into a hundred million [incarnations] and roam through the
various destinies, bringing sentient beings to fulfillment and
enabling them to realize the stage of Vajrasattva. <This indicates
the inconceivable benefits of the Dharma when one practices
in accordance with the rules of [this] rite.>
It also says (T. 20: 539a):
With the vajra of the three mysteries as a dominant condition
one is able to realize the resultant stage of the three bodies
of Vairocana.14
Sutras such as these all explain the methods of this samådhi
of swift e›ect and inconceivable supernatural power. If someone
should exert himself day and night without neglecting the [ritual]
rules, he will obtain the five supernatural faculties with his present
body, and if he gradually trains himself, he will advance to
Becoming a Buddha
79
enter the stage of the Buddha without abandoning this body. It is
as is explained in detail in the sutras.
On the basis of this meaning it says, “When empowered by the
three mysteries, [Buddhahood] is quickly manifested.” “Empower”
(lit., “add and hold”) expresses the great compassion of the Tathågata
and the faithful minds of sentient beings: the reflection of the
Buddha-sun appearing on the mind-water of sentient beings is
called “adding” and the mind-water of the practitioner sensing the
Buddha-sun is called “holding.”15 If the practitioner contemplates
well on this guiding principle, through the intercorrespondence of
his three mysteries [with those of the Tathågata] he will quickly
manifest and realize in his present body the originally existent
three bodies. Therefore it is said, “[Buddhahood] is quickly manifested.”
The meaning of “in this very body” (sokushin) is just like
that of the ordinary [terms] “at that very moment” (sokuji; i.e.,
immediately) or “on that very day” (sokujitsu; i.e., on the same day).
4. The Manifold Interconnectedness of Indra’s Net
Is Called “This Very Body”
As for “The manifold interconnectedness of Indra’s net is called
‘this very body,’” this gives a simile to explain the perfect interfusion
and nonobstruction of the deities’ three mysteries [as innumerable
as] the dust motes of [countless] lands. “Indra’s net” is
Indra’s jeweled net. “Body” means my body, the Buddha’s body,
and the bodies of sentient beings—these are called “body.” There
are also four kinds of bodies, namely, the own-nature [body], the
enjoyment [body], the transformation [body], and the homogeneous
[body]—these are called “body.” There are also three kinds:
they are letter, seal, and form. Bodies such as these are manifoldly
interconnected vertically and horizontally like the reflections [of
a single object] in [many] mirrors or the interpenetration of the
light of [many] lamps. That body is this body, and this body is that
body; the Buddha’s body is the bodies of sentient beings, and the
bodies of sentient beings are the Buddha’s body. They are not the
same, and yet they are the same; they are not di›erent, and yet
383c
K¥kai Texts
80
they are di›erent. Therefore, the mantra of the nonobstruction of
the three equals says: “Salutation <as always>, asame trisame
samaye svåhå.”16 The meaning of the first word (asame) is
“unequaled,” the next (trisame) is “three equals,” and that of the
last word (samaye) is “equality of three.” The “three” are Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha; body, speech, and mind are also three; and
the mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three. These three
dharmas are completely equal and one; they are one and yet
immeasurable [in number], immeasurable [in number] and yet
one, and they never become confused. Therefore it says, “The manifold
interconnectedness of Indra’s net is called ‘this very body.’”
5. Naturally Endowed with Sarvajñåna
As for “Naturally endowed with sarvajñåna,” in the Mahåvairocana
Sutra it says (T. 18: 22bc):
I am the original beginning of everything and am called
the support of the world;
My expounding of the Dharma is peerless, originally
quiescent, and unsurpassed.
Remarks: “I” is the self-designation of the Honored One Vairocana.
“Everything” refers to innumerable [entities]. “Original beginning”
is the original patriarch who from the very beginning has
naturally realized all dharmas [characterized by] this great freedom.
The Tathågata’s Dharma body and the original nature of
sentient beings both possess this principle of original quiescence,
but sentient beings are unaware and ignorant of it. Therefore, the
Buddha expounds this guiding principle to awaken sentient beings.
[In the Mahåvairocana Sutra] it also says (T. 18: 19b):
Those who hanker after cause and result,[…] those foolish
people are unable to understand mantras and the characteristics
of mantras. Why?
It is taught that the cause is not the agent, and its
result is not produced.

Even as a cause this cause is empty, and so how can
there be any result?
Know then that the results of mantras are completely
removed from cause and result.17
The verse “I (Vairocana) awoke to original non-birth,…dissociated
myself from causes and conditions” and [the verse] “All
dharmas are originally unborn;…they consist of causes and karma,
and are like empty space” quoted above—verses such as these all
express the meaning of “naturally endowed.”
Again, in the Adamantine Pinnacle Sutra it says (T. 18: 254a):18
[Vairocana’s] attendants composed of his own-nature, [name -
ly,] Vajrapa√i and the other Sixteen Great Bodhisattvas…,
each […] bring forth five million ko†i subtle vajras of the
Dharma body.
Passages such as this also have this meaning [of “naturally
en dowed”]. “Naturally” shows the way in which dharmas naturally
are. “Endowed” means “accomplished” and means “having
no deficiencies.”
“Sarvajñåna’’ (Jp.: sahannya) is Sanskrit. The older [transcription]
satsu’un is a corruption; in full it is saraba-shijanø (sarva
jñånam), which translates as “all-knowing wisdom.”19 As regards
“all-knowing wisdom,” “wisdom” means “judgment” and “discernment.”
All Buddhas are each possessed of the five wisdoms, the
thirty-seven wisdoms, and wisdoms [as innumerable as] the dust
motes of [countless] lands.
6. Mental Functions and Mind-kings
Are More Numerous Than the Dust Motes
of [Countless] Lands / Each Possessed of the
Five Wisdoms, of Infinite Wisdom
The next two lines (“Mental functions and mind-kings are more
numerous than the dust motes of [countless] lands / Each possessed
of the five wisdoms, of infinite wisdom”) express this meaning [of
384a
K¥kai Texts
82
all-knowing wisdom]. When indicating the quality of judgment, it
is known as “wisdom” ( jñåna); for showing [the sense of ] “accumulative
arising,” it is termed “mind” (citta); and for showing [the sense
of ] “norm-support,” it is termed “Dharma gateway” (dharma).20
Each of these designations is not separate from a person, and the
number of such persons exceeds the dust motes of [countless] lands.
It is therefore called “all-knowing wisdom” [because it is possessed
by all beings], and [its meaning] is not the same as in the case of
the exotericists, who use this term to set one wisdom over against
everything. “Mind-kings” is the wisdom of the essential nature of
the Dharma realm and so on, and “mental functions” is the manyand-
one –consciousness.21
“Each possessed of the five wisdoms” indicates that every
mind-king and mental function each has these [five wisdoms].
“Infinite wisdom” means [that this wisdom is] lofty, extensive,
and innumerable.
7. And Because of the Power [to Function]
as a Perfect Mirror There Is the
Real Wisdom of Enlightenment
As for “And because of the power [to function] as a perfect mirror
there is the real wisdom of enlightenment,” this gives the reason.
On what account are all Buddhas described as [having] the wisdom
of enlightenment? Namely, just as all forms are reflected in
a bright mirror on a high stand, so too is it with the mirror of the
mind of the Tathågata: the perfectly bright mirror of his mind
hangs high on the pinnacle of the Dharma realm and quietly illuminates
everything without distortion and without error. What
Buddha does not possess such a perfect mirror? Therefore it says,
“And because of the power [to function] as a perfect mirror there
is the real wisdom of enlightenment.”
